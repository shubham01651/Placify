# ðŸŽ¯ Placify â€“ Placement Management System

The primary goal of Placify is to streamline the campus placement and recruitment process by creating a centralized platform for all placement-related communication and activities.

Students often miss out on opportunities due to scattered updates shared across multiple platforms such as WhatsApp groups, Facebook posts, Gmail threads, and Excel sheets. In some cases, companies close applications before the communicated deadline, and students remain unaware because they were not constantly checking every channel.

Placify addresses this issue by bringing everything under one roofâ€”a unified system where students, coordinators, and administrators can interact, manage drives, share announcements, and stay updated without information overload or missed deadlines.
